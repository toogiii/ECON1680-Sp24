Sign up for the e-mail here.</br></br>On Friday evening, with Congress out of town on its summer recess and Americans heading into a mid-August weekend, the Bush administration sent a message to the states: The federal government will make it tougher for a national children's insurance program to cover the offspring of middle-income families.</br></br>The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid, and administration officials tell the New York Times that the changes are aimed at returning the program to its low- income focus and assuring it didn't become a replacement for private insurance. Administration point man Dennis Smith wrote to state officials saying there would be new restrictions on the District of Columbia and the 18 states -- including California and New York -- that extend or plan to extend coverage for children whose families make more than 250% of Federal poverty levels. For a family of three that 250% is $42,900, and for a family of four it's $51,625. Under the new limits, a child from a family making more would have to spend one year uninsured before qualifying, and any state that wants to extend coverage would have to assure Washington that at least 95% of children eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid are enrolled in one of the programs. But as the Associated Press reports, no state can currently make such assurances.</br></br>Rachel Klein, deputy director of health policy for advocacy group Families USA, tells the AP that since many families above the 250% threshold can't afford private insurance, ""the effect of this policy is to have more uninsured kids."" Ann Clemency Kohler, deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey, tells the Times the changes ""will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children."" States have already been imposing waiting periods and taking other steps to prevent parents from moving their children from private insurance to SCHIP, which currently serves some 6.6 million children, the Washington Post notes. The administration's new restrictions come as the program, which expires at the end of next month if Congress doesn't reauthorize it, is the subject of a larger political fight that pits the White House against Democrats and some Republicans in Congress and state capitals."\r\n842613457,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 1:59,,,no,1,wsj_398284048,11/14/91,Banking Bill Negotiators Set Compromise --- Plan to Widen Banks' Entry To Securities Business Is Dropped as Vote Nears,,,"WASHINGTON -- In an effort to achieve banking reform, Senate negotiators and the Bush administration have agreed to drop efforts to allow banks to expand further into the securities business.</br></br>The compromise is one of several the Senate Banking Committee is pursuing to remove obstacles its banking bill will face when the Senate starts voting on the measure, perhaps today.

Management is under pressure to reduce productivity losses, turnover, insurance costs and the risk of lawsuits for personal and property damage caused by drug-impaired workers. Management also is under sales pressure from a growing cadre of laboratories, test-kit manufacturers and consultants who extol the virtues of testing. A common argument is the following: ""Your competitors are starting to require drug tests. If you don't, their work force will be clean and you will end up with all the junkies.""</br></br>Many companies that have implemented widespread drug-testing programs, however, have learned that there is a downside to testing. They have experienced the protests of employees and civil libertarians and have watched the proliferation of lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, defamation and other legal theories. A Texas railroad employee was awarded $200,000 in damages when his employer misreported the results of a drug test. Numerous other cases are pending.</br></br>Is there a middle ground? Can safety and efficiency be protected without invading the privacy of applicants and employees?</br></br>A growing number of companies have concluded that drug testing should be the least important part of a comprehensive drug-abuse program. The starting point is a drug-awareness program to educate managers, supervisors and employees about the dangers and signs of drug abuse. The second part of the program is an effective employee-assistance program (EAP). Rehabilitation is preferable to punishment or dismissal (at least for initial or nonserious offenses) because it encourages employees to seek help voluntarily, improves labor relations and is cost-effective by restoring valuable employees to productive status. More than one company that heedlessly adopted a ""screen and fire"" policy on drugs had second thoughts after discovering traces of drugs in some of their most productive employees.</br></br>There may be a place for drug testing in a company's drug-abuse program, but there are limits to the effectiveness of testing. To begin with, the accuracy of some drug tests varies widely, and the test results are often unacceptable even when performed by professional laboratories. Last year the Centers for Disease Control published the results of a 10-year study of laboratory testing for amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, codeine, methadone and morphine.

As early as July 1984, for example, then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler proclaimed that the Reagan administration had ""broken {its} back."" This assessment seems to be widely shared within the business community. And this July, headlines announced that ""spending on health care in 1985 rose at the lowest level in two decades."" Unfortunately, rumors about the defeat of the ""health-care monster"" may be vastly exaggerated.</br></br>How did the health-care cost spiral start? During the 1960s and 1970s the American people implicitly signed a social contract with the nation's providers of health services that was so open-ended as to be almost incredible. Under this contract, the providers would be left alone to determine how best to treat the illnesses of their patients. As compensation they were issued keys to sundry health-insurance treasuries, there to recoup whatever auditable costs they had incurred (if they were hospitals) or to fetch whatever fees they deemed ""usual, customary and reasonable"" (if they were physicians). Only very mild and generally ineffective limits were ever placed on the sums taken by individual physicians or hospitals from these insurance treasuries. Not surprisingly, prices varied widely and often capriciously among providers, and overall outlays on health care climbed.</br></br>This benificent contract was written at a time when most experts thought the nation was short of both doctors and hospital beds, so that health-care providers largely dictated the terms of the contract. Inevitably, however, the very generosity of the deal drew into the medical profession legions of educated baby-boomers eager to do well by doing good. By the late 1970s, an erstwhile sellers' market had thus transformed itself into a buyers' market with surplus capacity all around.</br></br>More than two-thirds of all health services or products are paid at point of service, not by the patient, but by some third party -- either a private insurance carrier or the public sector. As early as the late 1970s, these third-party payers began attempting to control escalating health-care costs. After Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, a two-pronged attack was made upon the health-cost monster.</br></br>The first came from the business community, which pays for about a third of all health-care expenditures through employer-paid health-insurance premiums. It sought to control the rise in its premiums by forcing employees to share a greater proportion of their health-care bills at point of consumption, and by encouraging them to join so-called Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) or Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Under a PPO a business firm (and/or its insurance carrier) seeks price concessions from a limited set of doctors and hospitals who render care on a fee-for-service basis. In return for these price concessions, the firm offers its employees financial inducements to seek health care only from providers within the PPO network. Under the HMO contract, a network of physicians and hospitals contracts to provide a firm's employees all necessary health care in return for a flat, prepaid annual fee. The HMO thus has every incentive to minimize the costs of treating patients."\r\n842613463,FALSE,finalized,3,12/4/15 23:07,,,no,1,wsj_398737834,5/30/01,Sequenom to Buy Gemini Genomics In Stock Accord,,,"Sequenom Inc., a genomics-based biotechnology company, said it will acquire Gemini Genomics PLC of the United Kingdom in a stock swap valued at about $226.8 million, one of the first in what analysts expect to be a series of consolidations among genomics companies.</br></br>The deal combines two companies that are already working together closely in the search for human diseases linked to genetic defects.

But it is at the markets, brimming with traditionally designed wool sweaters, bags, hammocks and wall hangings -- all crafted on imported looms -- that the Otavaleno's much-touted entrepreneurial savvy is on display. Behind the walls of many humble homes in this town, substantial inventories of those same products are bound for markets in Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Europe and the U.S.</br></br>Located two hours north of Quito by car, on a winding and rutty road, this is said to be the only indigenous community -- of about 40 -- in the country never to have been brought under the control of the Spanish conquistadors.

Since August 1998 the country's currency, known as the sucre, has lost 80% of its value in dollar terms, destroying savings and living standards; 1999 gross domestic product contracted 26.6% in dollar terms.

Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump.

Maskin and Roger B. Myerson were awarded the Nobel prize in economics Monday for their study of ""mechanism design."" An abstract branch of economics that employs daunting formulas and heroic feats of mathematics, mechanism design is decidedly clear-eyed in its approach understanding always-less-than- perfect circumstances of economic exchanges. One way to understand the ""mechanisms"" these distinguished dismal scientists study is to think about an auction for, say, a Picasso painting. It's a pretty efficient way of getting people to admit -- by bidding -- how much they value the painting. And according to Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University and well-known economics blogger, essentially, these economists use math to analyze and describe that process of ""trying to get people to tell the truth or reveal information."" Jeffrey Ely, an economics professor at Northwestern University who works in the field, explains mechanism design as a sort of reverse engineering of game theory, a field in which people try to understand how individual incentives and structural rules interact and result in certain behaviors. But instead of just understanding the rules of existing systems, mechanism design focuses on designing them in such as way that a certain outcome is achieved. ""They developed the basic tools for thinking about institutions in this way,"" Mr. Ely said of today's award winners.</br></br>Alvin Roth is a professor of economics at Harvard University who has used some of the theories pioneered by today's Nobel award winners to help design programs such as the process by which medical students are placed in residency programs at hospitals. ""You might say that before modern game theory, economists looked at markets and other economic institutions sort of the way botanists look at plants, as naturally occurring mysteries to be studied,"" Mr. Roth wrote in an email. ""Mechanism design takes seriously that markets are built by people, and starts to ask what we can do with them, what we can't, and how best to go about it."" As such, their work has applications in a wide range of fields, from regulatory policies such as the Federal Communications Commission's somewhat abstract auctions of bandwidth on the wireless spectrum, to the residency-placement system devised Mr. Roth, to the kidney-donation swaps highlighted in today's Wall Street Journal. And, more generally, the economists' theories can be used as a framework to help identify when markets, auctions or other mechanisms -- such as matching programs -- might be better -- or ill -- suited for providing a specific outcome.</br></br>At 90 years old, Mr. Hurwicz is the oldest Nobel winner ever, according to the academy.

But in recent years, private inflows haven't kept pace with the growth in the current-account deficit and foreign central banks have stepped into the breach, buying more than $200 billion of U.S. assets, mostly Treasury bonds and bills, last year.

On July 31, the Commerce Department announced that its composite index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.9% in June. And on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points. Further steep increases followed, so that by last week's end the average was 102.81 points above its July 31 level.</br></br>There's no short, simple explanation of the linkage between the economy and stock market. But any serious effort to appraise one's prospects entails close attention to the other. An obvious tie involves profits. If it becomes clear that a company's profits are on the rise, demand for its shares is likely to increase, tending to push up their price. A subtler connection involves interest rates. Securities that offer fixed rates of interest compete for investors' dollars with common stocks, which offer dividends that may rise or fall according to changes in profitability. When interest rates fall, this renders interest-paying securities relatively less attractive. It's no coincidence that in general before the recent market surge profits were sharply on the rise and interest rates on the decline.</br></br>In all, a wide variety of factors can play upon the market. Among them are shifts in investor confidence, concern about rising or falling prices, worry over higher taxes or stiffer governmental regulations, changes in so-called margin requirements that limit what investors may borrow to buy stocks, the flow of money from overseas, major strikes and the failure of a large corporation. But business-cycle history leaves little doubt that the fundamental influence is the broad economic trend.</br></br>The 0.9% drop in the Commerce Department's leading-indicator index in June has been widely interpreted as a signal that the economy, at the least, will grow at a slower pace in coming months. This, in turn, has been seen as a good reason to invest in common stocks, since a slower-paced expansion would presumably last longer and be accompanied by somewhat lower interest rates.</br></br>The record shows, however, that a decline of only a month or two in the leading-indicator index by no means guarantees an economic slowing. In fact, the June drop was the first monthly decline since August 1982. Moreover, it's possible that subsequent revisions in the various components of the Commerce index may eventually turn the decline into an increase. Several times since August 1982 reported monthly declines in the index have indeed been revised into gains."\r\n842613581,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 10:22,,,no,1,wsj_399121561,2/12/09,U.S. News: Hints of Stability Emerge in Fragile Financial System,,,"Even as job losses mount and profits plunge, some glimmers of stabilization are emerging in global markets.</br></br>In the U.S., Europe and China, separate surveys of manufacturers' purchasing managers all inched upward in January, suggesting that the contraction in manufacturing activity could be slowing.

The impact of this volatility on U.S. farmers and manufacturers, developing countries, tourism, and investment flows has been immense and disruptive.</br></br>At last weekend's G7 meeting, the powerful group of finance ministers and central bankers accepted this, asserting that exchange rates should be flexible and reflect economic fundamentals. The U.S. hopes the G7 language will form a lasting consensus and be viewed as a set of long-term currency principles. But there's a hitch: Rather than ""reflecting"" fundamentals, the exchange rate is itself a key fundamental. It affects capital flows, jobs, inflation, and interest rates. Currency changes harm the relationship between debtors and creditors and dominate the profitability of many companies.</br></br>Without considering the exchange rate, there is not even a ballpark economic definition of a country's fundamentals -- one can't tell whether monetary policy is tight or loose, or inflation likely to rise or fall. If the idea is that strong economic fundamentals cause a strong currency -- as the Clinton administration argued -- it is unclear why the Bush administration seems so comfortable with the two- year weakness in the dollar. It surely doesn't agree with the dollar- bears' claim that U.S. fundamentals have deteriorated substantially due to the tax cuts and fiscal deficits.</br></br>My view is the opposite. U.S. fundamentals are much better now than in 2000, in large part due to the change in the value of the dollar and the improved tax structure. The fundamentals are reflected in important new records in GDP, total employment according to the household survey, corporate profits, productivity and disposable personal income. The U.S. potential growth rate in coming years is one of the best on record, and hard to explain if the current value of the dollar is thought to ""reflect"" economic fundamentals.</br></br>The irony in the fascination with the G7's exchange-rate language is that the causal relationship from economic fundamentals to currencies works so poorly.

Mr. Bernanke has long argued that being more transparent will make such policies more effective.</br></br>The Fed's efforts to telegraph its strategy left investors confused at key points about where it was heading, and some misread Mr. Bernanke's intentions about the bond-buying program and interest rates. That disconnect exacerbated a real-world problem: rising rates that by August showed signs of denting a budding housing recovery.</br></br>At present, the Fed has laid the groundwork to start reducing its bond purchases later this year or early next year.

It also could lower medical-care costs more effectively than will all the arbitrary cost-cutting that is now shaving most everyone's medical care down to the grimly skinny. The overdue task is to properly define what sensible substance-abuse treatment is.</br></br>Given the current obsession with controlling medical-care costs, what's sensible should bear some relation to what's affordable. Yet at the most publicized of alcohol- and drug-abuse treatment centers, the Fair Oaks hospital group (which sponsors the famous 800-COCAINE hotline), the current cost of a hospital day is $1,000, which exceeds the price of a day in the coronary-care unit of Massachusetts General Hospital. The cost of a full inpatient term of treatment at these centers -- four weeks to six months -- ranges from $28,000 to $160,000, with an average of $56,000. This is a spread whose lower end is higher than the cost of bypass surgery and all its attendant expense and whose upper end is more than double the average cost -- $70,000 -- of treating an AIDS patient. Most other middle-class centers cost $10,000 per term of inpatient treatment, while the Betty Ford Center charges $5,000, and Hazelden in Minnesota charges $4,000.</br></br>The reason no one questions these prices, not even the insurance companies who pay them, is that the alternative expense in addiction-related disease, lost productivity and crime is reckoned at $170 billion a year. With treatment success rates reported as high as 85% to 92% at (for instance) the Fair Oaks hospital group, the treatment prices have appeared eminently cost-effective, and the success rates miles ahead of those recorded over the past 50 years by public substance-abuse programs. The hitch, according to Dr. Chad Emrick of the University of Colorado (the only researcher to review all the literature on this subject), is that those success rates are more fantasy than fact. Both Dr. Emrick and Dr. George Vaillant, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School, say that, even when addressed in these same expensive treatment centers, alcoholism and drug abuse remain notoriously prone to relapse -- which confuses the meaning of ""success."" Many of those treated need retreatment two or three or more times.</br></br>Given prices of $160,000 or $56,000 or even $4,000 per term of treatment, how can we afford care for those who are habitual and excessive users of drugs and/or alcohol? There are an estimated 40 million people who regularly abuse these substances. Were all of them to be treated only once at even the lowest-priced outpatient center (Hazelden, at $1,800 per term of treatment) the cost would be on the order of $72 billion. That's one-fifth of annual current medical expenses in the U.S. If, against high odds, half of these heavy users could break their habits by themselves, the remainder would still cost some $36 billion to treat -- once. What is the answer?</br></br>To begin with, Drs. Emrick and Vaillant and others have not found a scintilla of evidence to show that expensive treatment works any more effectively than less expensive kinds. Mr. Vaillant, author of the classic book ""The Natural History of Alcoholism,"" says, ""What's important is that treatment be available for everyone as often as they need it."" On just this precept, the Cambridge and Somerville Program for Alcohol Recovery in Massachusetts, developed by Harvard Medical School physicians, has for the past 16 years treated about 20,000 patients a year at an annual cost of $1 million. Its bywords are easy accessibility and versatility of approach. The program includes a 24-hour walk-in clinic, outpatient groups, groups for families, women's groups, a detoxification unit and three halfway houses. It boasts no amazing statistics or new wonder therapies, but in its humdrum and unpretentious way it weans a great many people from their injurious addictions, some permanently, others only for a while at a time.

The official measure of net national saving begins with gross saving, which has been rising. Gross saving reached 17.3% of gross domestic product in 1997. To calculate the net saving, usually viewed as national saving, one must subtract depreciation or ""consumption of fixed capital."" This brings the rate of net national saving down to $555 billion, or 6.5% of GDP. That $555 billion would add about 2.8% to the current net stock of tangible capital, public and private. Thus it implies a growth in capital somewhat higher than commonly forecast long-run growth rate of the economy.</br></br>Even this net rate might not be an adequate measure of growth in a period of rapid technological advance. The depreciated capital might be replaced by more productive new capital, so that even without adding to the measure of net capital stock the capacity for growth would increase. A better perspective could be gained by looking at real gross domestic investment, private and public. That total, financed in part by foreign net investment equal to 2% of our GDP, comes to 19.5% of GDP.</br></br>This higher real percentage reflects the falling price of much investment, particularly in computers; relatively more investment goods than consumption goods are being bought for each dollar. The net real domestic investment of $592 billion (1992 dollars) in 1997 was thus 8.2% of real GDP, suggesting that real capital stock was growing even more rapidly relative to real output."\r\n842613691,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 13:34,,,no,1,wsj_1021114707,6/20/12,Washington Should Lock In Low Rates,,,"Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>Pope Julius II paid Michelangelo to paint a Vatican ceiling.

He said they were a major crisis, but people were being misled about their severity because most of the usual indicators -- such as prices of financial assets, inflation and real economic activity -- were giving off reasonably rosy, but false, signals.</br></br>My wife was skeptical. Couldn't it be that all of these indicators were right, and that the budget deficit was just not a big deal? Anyhow, where did this CBO economist get his information if not from all the data that gave different answers? Probably he was just a slave of some outmoded economic theory that predicted effects that hadn't shown up. Moreover, didn't David Ricardo have a theory that said that budget deficits were roughly equivalent to taxation, and didn't this theory conform pretty well with the evidence that this CBO fellow said we should ignore? I agreed with my wife and assured her that a growing number of economists were coming to that viewpoint, but that we still numbered only 22% of the membership of the American Economic Association.</br></br>I admit that federal budget deficits since 1984 have been higher than I would have predicted, based on a model that views deficits as a device to smooth out tax collections over time. For example, the budget deficit for the current fiscal year, when measured as the change in the privately held public debt, is about $210 billion. I would have predicted a deficit of between $110 billion and $170 billion: $60 billion associated with the federal net interest payments of $130 billion, $50 billion for the persistent failure to reach full employment, and as much as $60 billion to offset the surplus of the state and local sector. That leaves an excess deficit of $40 billion to $100 billion. Smaller but still significantly positive values apply for 1984 and 1985.</br></br>I see three possible explanations for the large budget deficits of recent years. First, they may simply be mistakes. In this case they are also good experiments, which economists can use to figure out the effects of budget deficits on the economy.</br></br>Second, people may believe that the ""Reagan Revolution"" portends a declining share of federal spending in gross national product. In that case current spending is temporarily high, and it makes sense to run a budget deficit rather than to enact a temporary increase in tax rates.

Russian Crisis Shows the Need,,,"It seems that postcommunist Russia poses a greater threat to global capitalism than the Soviet Union ever did. The Russian debt default in mid-August has generated financial shock waves that could drive next year's growth rate of the world economy to the lowest level in the postwar era. There are worrying signs that the U.S. will experience a credit crunch in the banking sector that could offset the benefits of lower interest rates. And while the European economy still enjoys moderate growth momentum, it will be highly vulnerable to an export slump if the rest of the world continues to slow.</br></br>The magnitude of the correction after the Russian default illustrates how profoundly global financial markets have changed as new technology has driven down the cost of trading, hedge funds have gained access to leverage from bankers, and investors have developed an increasing appetite for risk following the long Wall Street boom. In turn, these changes have exposed how vulnerable the global financial system is, and underscored the need for an international lender of last resort.</br></br>One vulnerability is the remarkable interdependence that has developed among markets because of the growth of global capital flows and the increasing role of highly leveraged investors in allocating capital. In the late 1980s, capital flows to developing countries were less than $50 billion. The Cold War's end and the growth of financial markets in developing countries drove this figure up to more than $300 billion in 1996.</br></br>There has also been a dramatic expansion in the size of security markets. In the U.S., the ratio of stock-market capitalization to gross domestic product has nearly tripled during the 1990s while the mutual-fund industry now has greater assets than the banking system. The spectacular performance of the U.S. equity market stimulated an appetite for risk among high-income investors that encouraged a proliferation of new hedge funds. According to survey data, the U.S. now has more than 1,200 hedge funds with $200 billion to $300 billion in assets. During the 1990s these funds have become leading players in emerging markets.</br></br>When Russia defaulted, it did not merely force some hedge funds to liquidate securities in other emerging markets. Instead, it produced such losses that many bankers felt compelled to curtail both their security market and their lending exposure in emerging markets. It also prompted some hedge funds to repay the low-cost yen loans they had taken out to finance security purchases and thus encouraged a large rally in the yen. Before August, few investors would have expected a Russian default to shatter Latin America's access to credit or produce a surge in the value of the yen, but such are the consequences of today's new global financial integration."\r\n842613747,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 8:48,,,no,1,wsj_398853233,7/6/98,Theragenics Shares Fall 36% on Report Criticizing Outlook,,,"Shares of Theragenics Corp. plunged 36% Thursday after an analyst raised doubts about prospects for the maker of medical radiological devices.</br></br>Theragenics executives, as well as other analysts, disputed the analyst's position.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both say is needed to stimulate the economy out of its doldrums. (Coincidently, it was the financial backing that the Federal Reserve originally offered for the Bear Stearns deal, before trimming it by $1 billion.) Sen. Obama laid out his economic plan today, and it helped sharpen policy differences between the two Democratic rivals, as well as Republican candidate John McCain. The stimulus prescription, it seems, is the political divider. Of course, both parties have already voted through a much larger $152 billion stimulus plan. That measure was designed to get people spending and businesses investing, however. The monies the two Democrats suggest adding to the pot would go toward battling the fallout from the housing crunch. Sen. Clinton's $30 billion would mostly go to help states and cities buy foreclosed properties. Mr. Obama has the same idea, but he would dedicate $10 billion of his stimulus to helping states head off cuts in services as tax revenues decline and to expanding unemployment insurance.</br></br>On the Republican side, Sen. McCain has sworn off using government money for bailouts, although he backed the Bear Stearns deal as a fix to ""systemic financial problems."" He also doesn't approve lowering the down-payment requirements for Federal Housing Authority-backed loans as a way to help low-income homeowners. On the contrary, he wants to raise them. Sens. Obama and Clinton can agree on very little these days, but they have united in dismissing Sen. McCain's policy as fiddling while Rome burns. Sen. Clinton revived her ""3a.m. phone call"" image that she had used in an attack ad on Sen. Obama, and applied it to Sen. McCain: ""The phone is ringing, and he would just let it ring and ring."" In his speech, Mr. Obama said Sen. McCain's plan ""amounts to little more than watching this crisis happen."" Sen. McCain struck back in a statement before Sen. Obama's speech had even ended. ""There is a tendency for liberals to seek big government programs that sock it to American taxpayers while failing to solve the very real problems we face,"" he said. Sen. McCain agrees with his opponents in some areas.

At the same time, it can also be said that the social fallout from that policy has raised legitimate political concerns. That is part and parcel of a democracy.</br></br>It is true that spending on pharmaceutical products represents only 7% to 8% of total national health spending. It is also true that total annual spending on medicine typically lags behind total annual consumer spending on alcohol and tobacco. But as early as 1982 I sought to alert executives of the industry to the fact that spending on their products represents a huge hit on the budgets of low-income, chronically ill people who typically lack insurance for prescription drugs, and that sooner or later this fiscal distress would trigger legitimate concerns among politicians.</br></br>Throughout the 1980s I urged members of the industry to recover their huge overhead costs mainly from middle- and upper-income households, and not from chronically ill poor people. That could have been achieved either by urging on Congress coverage for medicine for all low-income people (a strategy used in other countries) or through some analogue of food stamps, a special discount credit card or some other price-discriminatory device. I recall that idea being laughed off as ""Ivy League socialism"" during the heady 1980s. In retrospect, it may appear as good politico-economic advice.</br></br>The industry's failure to deal with these political pressures pre-emptively does not ""deserve"" punishment.

He has clearly demonstrated one more time the relationship between real and nominal interest rates as determined by inflation and expectations of future inflation. Historically over the years the zero-risk real cost of money (interest rate) has varied relatively little from three to four percent. Traditionally, rate ""surcharges"" are added to offset, or insure against, perceived risks in a given investment opportunity; the higher the inherent risk, the higher the nominal rate demanded.</br></br>Then came the steeply rising inflation of the recent past. These years taught investors a painful lesson. The ""surcharge"" added to cover the risk of expected inflation was grossly and routinely underestimated, and real interest rates actually went negative. While lenders suffered losses, borrowers loved their bonanza and have come to expect that it should continue to their benefit.</br></br>Lenders have good reason to be gun-shy. It matters not what scares the lender, be it large deficits or something else real or imagined. Each lender judgmentally sets his perception of the proper minimum add-on to cover expected inflation within the life of the investment, and fixes his acceptable rates accordingly. For the most part investor collective judgment will be borne out (or will be adjusted with time) except under conditions of steep change; i.e., runaway inflation or a bust.</br></br>Real interest rates are not high; they change little. It is lender analysis of risk that sets the pattern of nominal rates. Currently it is the fear and anticipation of future inflation that is at the center of lender thinking. Tax rates are hardly relevant. And the idea of lenders being willing to accept rates which may give negative real returns is only for fairy tales.</br></br>R.E.

Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive Speaker of the House, has pledged to raise the minimum by over $2, to $7.25 from $5.15. And President Bush has already signaled he'd go along. At the state level, six states not only approved minimum wage hikes in referendums this week but indexed the minimum to inflation going forward. We hope Mr. Bush fights off any attempt at federal indexation and insists on a provision to protect small business.</br></br>Raising the minimum wage has been a hardy perennial of the left for decades now. What is striking is the degree to which is has come to be seen as an economic free lunch. Even some reputedly unbiased economists have started to tout the view that raising the minimum wage has no discernible effect on job creation.</br></br>But if this were true, they'd be calling for a $10, $20 or even $50- an-hour minimum wage. They're not, and neither is Nancy Pelosi. That's because the law of demand is one of the most dependable precepts of economics. It says that when the price of something goes up, demand for it goes down. An employee's wages are the price the employer pays for his services, so raising their wages means forcing employers to pay more for workers. The price goes up and there is downward pressure on demand for workers. Other things being equal, jobs are lost.</br></br>For a long time, this was so obvious that no serious person doubted it. But a couple of studies in the 1990s purported to find no evidence of job loss associated with minimum-wage hikes, and it's been off to the races ever since. Classical economics teaches that for a given job, there is a market-clearing price -- the price at which both someone is willing to do it and someone else is willing to pay them to do it. If you raise the legal minimum above that price, you may get more people willing to perform the job, but you'll probably also get less people (employers) willing to pay the new, higher price to get the job done.</br></br>To picture how this works, think about the grocery bagger in the supermarket, a classic low-wage service job. Supermarkets hire grocery baggers for the minimum wage, or close to it, because it's a perk that makes their customers' experience a bit nicer and helps move the lines along, possibly requiring fewer cashiers, who cost more to hire than grocery baggers."\r\n842613840,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 3:31,,0,no,0.6364,wsj_1494734875,2/6/14,"The 10-Point.; A personal, guided tour to the best scoops and stories every day in The Wall Street Journal, from Editor in Chief Gerard Baker.",,,"Good morning from New York,</br></br>The U.S. economy is improving and the unemployment rate is falling, but we report on what seems to be a fixed feature of our new economy.

The revision, we find, reflects not only Pakistani objections to the strikes but logistical constraints on the CIA as U.S. troops are expected to pull out of Afghanistan at the end of 2014.

How else to interpret his recent move to join ranks with his opponents in Sacramento to put a pork-heavy $37 billion bond infrastructure proposal on the November ballot?</br></br>Mr. Schwarzenegger's move officially marks the end of his grand plans to reform Sacramento, earning him kudos from many California Democrats. Sen. Don Perata, the most influential Democrat in the state legislature, and Senate Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez have praised Mr. Schwarzenegger's leadership and pledged to campaign with him this fall to promote the initiative. Making joint appearances with prominent Democrats while he is campaigning for re-election will help cement Mr. Schwarzenegger's image as a political moderate, something he has been trying hard to cultivate in this bluest of blue states since last year. That's when the state's public unions accused him of right-wing partisanship, and defeated the bold reform initiatives he put on the ballot to curtail their influence on state government and politics.</br></br>The real issue, however, is what this bond measure will do to California. Few doubt the need for California to invest in its crumbling infrastructure. But this is an infrastructure bond in name only.

A bulk of its money won't fund general infrastructure -- an acceptable use of general-obligation bonds like these -- but such things as cheap multifamily dwellings for low-income families, and down-payment assistance for first-time home buyers.</br></br>The education bond is equally misguided, given that 40% of the state's $94 billion general-fund revenues are already constitutionally earmarked for education. Moreover, California voters approved a total of $25 billion for school-construction bonds in 2002 and 2004 to reduce overcrowding. If there is still not enough money for new schools, it is not because of lack of state spending, but abject waste by individual districts.

Mundell, a Columbia University economist, won the Nobel economics prize yesterday. Following are excerpts from an article he published in the July-August 1990 issue of the Rivista di Politica Economica, an Italian economics journal. (Reprinted with permission.)</br></br>Supply-side economics emerged as a political force partly as a reaction against the steep progressivity of personal and corporate income taxes and partly as a result of the breakdown of the international monetary system in 1971. The principal features of the supply-side program were a reform of the tax system, featuring a drastic slashing of marginal tax rates, and a reform of the international monetary system to one based on stable exchange rates anchored by gold or some alternative international asset.</br></br>The United States had enacted high income tax rates after it entered World War I, and they were only gradually lowered, to a maximum rate of 25% under {Treasury} Secretary {Andrew} Mellon. But in June 1932, during the last year of the Hoover administration, marginal income tax rates were suddenly raised again to a maximum level of 60%. They remained at or (frequently) considerably above this level for half a century. The grand bargain entered into by both Democratic and Republican administrations up to 1981 was the exchange of punitive marginal income tax rates to satisfy the political left in exchange for sweeping tax loopholes to placate the political right.</br></br>The collapse of monetary discipline with flexible exchange rates in 1973 and the subsequent oil embargo and increase in oil prices led to an inflation that further exacerbated the progressivity of the tax system. At the same time the absence of a stable monetary environment led to rising interest rates and exchange rate fluctuations that, almost arbitrarily, altered relative labor costs and international competitiveness. The exchange rate was determined increasingly by volatile international capital movements rather than the requirements of international trade. Reform of the international monetary system was therefore the second pillar in the platform of supply-side economics.</br></br>Supply-side economics addressed itself directly to policy considerations rather than theoretical abstractions. It would be a mistake, however, to believe that it lacks any less of a scientific foundation than the older demand-side schools of monetarism and Keynesianism, or the new classical school. Its own academic credentials lie in the solid allocation-theoretic literature of neo-classical economics and the policy-oriented models of global monetarism and macroeconomics."\r\n842614047,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 1:20,,0,no,0.6803,wsj_398120072,4/27/89,Short-Selling Is Now for the Stodgy --- Pension Funds Join Others Using Tactic,,,"NEW YORK -- Short-selling, among the riskiest of all stock market strategies, is starting to win converts among the most conservative of all investors -- pension funds.</br></br>Unlike ordinary investors, short-sellers make money when a stock goes down, not up.

On April 18, for example, a typical article in a British journal suggested that in the preceding year, Treasury Secretary Baker ""has taken out balance of payments insurance by persuading foreign central banks to suppress an upsurge of American interest rates by purchasing nearly $200 billion of U.S. securities"" (emphasis added). If the central banks ever stopped financing our trade deficit by buying Treasury securities, the experts agreed, then the dollar would drop by 30% and interest rates would soar.</br></br>Now, however, foreign central banks are not only not buying dollars, but instead selling billions. Yet the dollar nonetheless remains quite strong, and U.S. bond yields have gone down, not up. If it really required $100 billion to $200 billion of intervention to prop up the dollar, how can things have suddenly changed so much? Much credit for the dollar's firming is given to recent dramatic narrowing of the monthly trade-deficit figures. But in actual dollar terms, that is not the big story.</br></br>What has changed in the first half of 1988 appears to be mainly the capital account (investment) rather than the current account (trade). Americans are investing less abroad, leaving fewer foreign transactions to finance by selling dollars, while foreigners are investing more in the U.S., and thus buying dollars to finance those investments. The U.S. is clearly looking relatively more attractive to world investors. Bond prices have recently increased in the U.S., but fallen in Germany, the U.K. and Japan. Stock prices are also near this year's peak in the U.S., but the largest foreign stock markets are well below their peaks when measured in U.S. dollars.</br></br>Of course, the dollar's rise and the improved picture for U.S. investments are mutually reinforcing -- it is hard to pinpoint where the chicken-and-egg cycle began. But by itself, the stronger dollar should take some competitive pricing pressure off the industries of countries such as Germany and Japan, thus helping their stocks. So, the fact that their markets nonetheless remain much weaker than those here, when measured in the same currency, indicates that discounted profit opportunities look stronger in the U.S.</br></br>The U.S. is not alone.

The president is correct in focusing on this challenge.</br></br>In 1950 there were 16 taxpaying workers for every retired person in the U.S. Today there are just over three workers per retiree, and the ratio is expected to fall below two during the next century. If Social Security benefits are to be maintained under present arrangements, substantial tax increases will be required on workers and companies -- a burden that will discourage employment. Alternatively, other government receipts will be required or large government deficits will reappear. Small wonder that Mr. Clinton has searched for a magic bullet that might painlessly avoid the hard choices.</br></br>There are two parts to the president's proposal. The first is to preserve the budget surplus and allocate a substantial proportion to the trust fund. The second is to shore up the system by investing $700 billion from the trust fund in the stock market over the next 15 years. Presumably by investing in stocks that historically have produced returns considerably above the yield on long-term Treasury bonds, the trust fund would grow more rapidly, and the date when the fund would run out of money would be pushed out much later in the century.</br></br>Mr. Clinton's proposal to invest part of the trust fund in equities is the more radical part of his plan. It is a bad idea with unpredictable and probably damaging consequences. Moreover, simply investing a part of the trust fund in stocks will not provide the extra resources to spare us from making hard choices during the next century.</br></br>Having the government invest in private securities runs against the principles of free markets and could well interfere with the efficiency of the capital-allocation process. While the government would undoubtedly propose that the funds be given to an independent or private agency that would invest in a very broad equity index of perhaps thousands of securities, such a plan would necessarily increase the allocation of capital to larger companies at the expense of very small entrepreneurial concerns that lack the liquidity to accommodate large government purchases.

The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.</br></br>And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?</br></br>Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.</br></br>Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.</br></br>Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end.

Similarly, today the question about entitlements is not whether Medicare or Social Security will be fixed but whether these repairs will involve reduced benefits and enhanced efficiency or will instead entail more taxes. In general, the success and permanence of fiscal adjustments depend on their form, especially on whether governments restrain the growth of outlays.</br></br>The idea that the form of a fiscal adjustment matters more than the amount is the theme of a recent International Monetary Fund study by Alberto Alesina and Roberto Perotti, ""Fiscal Adjustment in OECD Countries: Composition and Macroeconomic Effects."" The authors examined the experience with budget-deficit reduction in 20 major developed countries in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development from 1960 to 1994.</br></br>In 62 of the 378 annual observations the study considered, the government was conducting a fiscal adjustment, defined as a reduction in the cyclically adjusted budget deficit by at least 1.5% of GDP. However, only about one-quarter of these adjustments were successful three years later -- successful meaning that the fall in the fiscal deficit was sustained or that the cumulated reduction in the ratio of the public debt to GDP was at least five percentage points. Examples of successes were Ireland and Sweden in the late 1980s and Denmark in the mid-1980s. The United States made the success list only for 1976.</br></br>The interesting finding in the Alesina-Perotti study is that a plan's success or failure depends on the composition of the reform. For one thing, the successful cases concentrated much more on spending reductions than on revenue increases. In the successes, 73% of the deficit reduction involved spending less, whereas for the failures, only 44% took this form.</br></br>The composition of the spending cuts also differed markedly. In the successes, 51% of the spending decreases were in transfers and government wages, while 20% was in public investment. For the failures, only 17% of the reduced spending was on transfers and government wages, whereas a striking 63% was in public investment. Referring to the successful reform model as type 1, the authors write, ""The reason why type 1 adjustments were successful is that they tackle the two items of the budget, government wages and welfare programs, which have the strongest tendency to automatically increase."" In contrast, in the typical unsuccessful effort, described as type 2, the focus on cuts in public investment reveals a short-term outlook with no lasting commitment to fiscal discipline."\r\n842614188,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 8:51,,,no,1,wsj_398326840,6/7/93,Entertainment: Political Humorists Thrive in Clinton Era,,,"WASHINGTON -- President Clinton may be struggling with the outcry over his appointments and his $200 haircut, but he is generating big business for one segment of the economy -- political humorists.</br></br>""There's no recession in the comedy industry,"" says Elaina Newport, a writer-performer for the musical comedy group The Capitol Steps.

Issued by state, county or other municipal development agencies on behalf of small-business borrowers, IDBs had two main attractions. First, the interest they paid was exempt from federal taxes. And second, banks could deduct 80% of the interest they paid to borrow money to invest in IDBs. That made banks by far the biggest buyers of such bonds.</br></br>The tax bill took several whacks at tax-exempt IDBs. It disallowed their use in many kinds of projects, particularly real-estate development. It cut in half the amount of such IDBs a state could issue each year. And, most important, it eliminated the 80% exclusion for banks, which lost much of their incentive to buy the bonds.</br></br>THE IMPACT was dramatic. The Council of Industrial Development Bond Issuers in Washington estimates the volume of new IDBs issued by state and local development authorities on behalf of small businesses in 1986 was only about half the previous year's $17.5 billion total. (Though the tax bill didn't become law until Jan. 1, 1987, uncertainty about its provisions kept banks out of the market for small-issue IDBs most of the year.)"\r\n842614199,FALSE,finalized,3,12/5/15 19:16,,,no,1,wsj_816176731,12/7/10,Corporate News: Corner Office Turned Pressure Cooker,,,"Jeffrey Kindler, who stepped down as Pfizer Inc.'s chief executive on Sunday, citing burnout, is the rare CEO to say that the job wore him out.</br></br>In fact, occupying the high-powered cocoon known as the corner office is more stressful than ever, thanks to a greater emphasis on globalization, stiffer competition, heightened government regulation and the weak economic recovery, say former CEOs, corporate directors and management experts.</br></br>Compared with four years ago, pressures on CEOs ""are substantially different -- especially in certain industries,"" said Steve Reinemund, who retired in 2006 as PepsiCo Inc.

Aside from skating on thin ice with investors, there is political risk from politicians who are looking at its operations with growing crankiness.</br></br>In the immediate post-Enron period, investors went on orange alert when increased scrutiny revealed that Fannie has serious problems with corporate governance, financial disclosure and reporting. More recently came revelations that Fannie was having trouble managing its huge portfolio of assets. A bad guess on the direction of interest rates exposed a giant mismatch between the maturities of its assets and liabilities, and demonstrated how vulnerable Fannie is to interest-rate risk.</br></br>The bizarre thing is that Fannie willingly (and happily) exposes itself to interest-rate risk. There is nothing in its government charter that even remotely requires Fannie to borrow great gobs of money to purchase and hold a huge portfolio of mortgages. Fannie does it because it is wildly profitable. Because of the implied government guarantee of its debt, Fannie can borrow at very low rates and then lend out that money at higher rates by retaining or repurchasing the mortgages it has securitized. This opportunity to borrow low and lend high is so seductive for profits, it's almost a form of entrapment.</br></br>It's such a good deal, in fact, that Fannie has issued an amazing amount of debt. Currently its outstanding debt is around $800 billion. Moreover, Fannie's debt relative to its small capital base gives it enormous leverage.

This is well below levels necessary for FDIC-insured commercial banks; even government securities dealers carry capital around 5% of assets. Fannie is running with this huge leverage (about 54-to-1) because it can -- shareholders, at least until this year, didn't seem to care.</br></br>What about its creditors?
